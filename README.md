#### What user stories were completed this iteration?

In this iteration we spent a long time working with a weather API in Java. We spent a while looking at tutorials but were unable to successfully import APIs, especially after having trouble handling a variety of errors. We decided to switch to using a dataset including historical weather data from Honolulu to play around with because we felt we could still manipulate the data in some interesting ways. We have a temperature CSV set up and a precipitation CSV ready to go.

#### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

TODO: Someone else fill this in

#### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

The API we were trying to implement did not end up working. We still have an XML file in because we will try implementing one more time before the next iteration before departing from the idea entirely.

#### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
