# project-christopher-isha-noah-roshan
#### Project Description

Our project is meant to be similar to Apple's Weather App. We plan to be able to show actual and predicted temperatures and precipitation for a given date or date range. Currently we are only using data for Honolulu, HI.

#### What user stories were completed this iteration?

In this iteration we focused on correcting mistakes from Iteration 1 and improving functionality. During the iteration we completed:
* Allowing the user to see year-to-date precipitation for their chosen date
* Allowing the user to choose any date within the specified range
* Displaying empty data values from CSV data

#### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

For Iteration 3 will be foucsed on the following, some of which we have already begun implementing:
* Allowing the user to see a 7-day temperature recap
* Allowing the user to see the average temperature and total precipitation over a 7-day period.
* Allowing the user to choose between viewing a single date's weather or weather for a 7-day range. 
* Allowing the user to choose the weather location.

#### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Our DateRange and UserInputDateRange classes are not fully functional as we are saving them for next iteration. However, they should not impact the current functionality of WeatherData. 

#### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
After cloning and entering the repository on the command line, run the following commands:
* javac src/WeatherData.java
* java src/WeatherData
